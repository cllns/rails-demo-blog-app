# Rails Demo App

This is a complete implementation
of the blog app from
[the Rails 'Getting Started' guide](http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#adding-a-second-model).

I tried to find this completed code
since I needed a simple app
that many people would be familiar with,
but I couldn't find a recent and reliable copy of the code.

So I went through that whole guide,
though I already know Rails.

I hope this saves someone the time I had to spend going through it.
:)

## Rails 4.2
Specifically, I went through the 'edge guides' version on December 29, 2015.
It's up-to-date with Rails 4.2.
